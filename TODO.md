# TODO

- Remove unused auto-loaded nvim plugins (e.g. matchit)
- Add nvim git command to visualize unchanged file side-by-side with windiff
- Add nvim git command to visualize merge conflicts with windiff
- (maybe) move nvim lua files dealing with git as exported git dotfiles
- write handy snippets (e.g. python)
- Only pull repository info for the specific commit
- Find a way to automatically name tmux windows with useful information. Try to ask suggestions to chatGPT for this.
- Update tmux, nvim, git versions and check for new functionalities
- Check out https://github.com/abhinav/tmux-fastcopy
- Consider using a mini-modal solution to pane resizing, both in tmux and nvim, to make it unnecessary for alt and ctrl to be pressed together (inspiration: https://github.com/whame/tmux-modal)
- Consider a solution to easily reorder panes in a window in tmux
- Consider a solution that saves content of tmux panes in a backup directory, so that you can have an idea of what you were working on after a reboot. Potentially, we could keep track of the state of the shells with hooks, so that we can reinflate the state automatically afterwards!
- Add tmux keybind to kill sessions without detaching (must be properly safeguarded)
- Move all dotfiles to separate git submodule
- Implement two different breadcrumbs command: `trail` (current) and `scatter` (recursively trail all directories, optionally with a max depth)
- Write READMEs for all modules
- Add configuration for optimized Xournal++ use (one hand for keyboard, other for pen)
- Compile ffmpeg and imagemagick
- Write aliases for ffmpeg and imagemagick
- Add automatic linting
- Add docker (utils or module)
- Always wrap lua functions with commands to make it clear we are running those with keybindings in nvim
- Explore frecency solutions (zsh, nvim, tmux, ...)
- Think of burger hash functions alternatives that might be more readable (e.g. rely on letters from the source word, perhaps reshuffling them?)
- Look for/implement neovim command that restores all swap files as buffers (useful in case of crashes)
- Look for possible injection vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to using arbitrary paths to build command strings
- Refactor nvim dev modules to always be directories with an `init.lua` and other files that can be exported
- Create alias to deal with processes more easily (exposed ports with `lsof`, better `psg`, etc.)
- Look into tmux automatic-rename (can it be used to do what we currently do in a built-in way? can it be turned off if it's an annoyance?)
- Create a manager for tmux sessions you can only access in session 0. The manager will have you visualize all sessions and decide which to kill, perhaps with a multiselection. Killed sections have their tmux panes shut down, unless a command is running in the pane. If it is, no pane in the session is killed.
