# TODO

- Remove unused auto-loaded nvim plugins (e.g. matchit)
- Add nvim git command to visualize unchanged file side-by-side with windiff
- Add nvim git command to visualize merge conflicts with windiff
- (maybe) move nvim lua files dealing with git as exported git dotfiles
- write handy snippets (e.g. python)
- Only pull repository info for the specific commit
- Check out https://github.com/abhinav/tmux-fastcopy
- Consider using a mini-modal solution to pane resizing, both in tmux and nvim, to make it unnecessary for alt and ctrl to be pressed together (inspiration: https://github.com/whame/tmux-modal)
- Consider a solution that saves content of tmux panes in a backup directory, so that you can have an idea of what you were working on after a reboot. Potentially, we could keep track of the state of the shells with hooks, so that we can reinflate the state automatically afterwards!
- Move all dotfiles to separate git submodule
- Implement two different breadcrumbs command: `trail` (current) and `scatter` (recursively trail all directories, optionally with a max depth)
- Write READMEs for all modules
- Add configuration for optimized Xournal++ use (one hand for keyboard, other for pen)
- Compile ffmpeg and imagemagick
- Write aliases for ffmpeg and imagemagick
- Add automatic linting
- Add docker (utils or module)
- Explore frecency solutions (zsh, nvim, tmux, ...)
- Look for/implement neovim command that restores all swap files as buffers (useful in case of crashes)
- Look for possible injection vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to using arbitrary paths to build command strings
- Refactor nvim dev modules to always be directories with an `init.lua` and other files that can be exported
- Create alias to deal with processes more easily (exposed ports with `lsof`, better `psg`, etc.)
- Find nvim window reordering solution (can be less complete than tmux's since closing a pane won't close the underlying buffer)
- Look into other tools for a richer, semantic diff
- Find a better way to manage zsh history (right now it starts from scratch each time we create a new session, not ideal)
- Implement git ls-files by modification date both as a command and in nvim
- Implement nvim string/lines diff solution (search the web, an idea could be to compare yank register and visual selection)
- Implement non-intrusive monitoring of key metrics like MEM usage, GPU usage, Disk usage (they should only be visually noticeable if above a critical threshold)
- Find a way to effortlessly move to edited parts of a Git-tracked file in neovim (not necessarily next/previous hunk from the git nvim plugin)
- Implement a standardized solution for logging of errors that are hard to reproduce
- Check for new functionalities of nvim, git versions
- Update nvim to past v0.9.5. This version takes a while to close while keeps consuming stdin, at least when compiled manually. For now we reverted back to 0.9.4. Possibly related: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/18670#issuecomment-1133496341
- Update nvim-treesitter to v0.9.2 or above (currently breaks with nvim 0.9.2 due to incompatibility with builtin lua parser, ref: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/3970)
- Look into not relying on Makefile to build nvim, since it seems to be broken from 0.9.2 onwards (ref: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27475#issuecomment-1948174057)
- Look into whether we can replace separate python envs with just one, and/or, perhaps simplier, just use pip install --user
- Add git-active-files to https://github.com/ahmetsait/toolgit
- Update git configuration with work-specific .gitconfig
- Look into using a session-bound SSH agent to use work key only for shells in the work session
