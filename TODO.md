# TODO

- Remove unused auto-loaded nvim plugins (e.g. matchit)
- In the installation script, generate dynamically some files (e.g. append source instructions to zshrc), then compare the final result with the current files to decide whether to backup them
- Make the languages supported in a workspace a first-class citizen of nvim (maybe even global) to lift them from current awkward position as submodules in lsp (and, possibly, treesitter)
- Add nvim git command to visualize unchanged file side-by-side with windiff
- Add nvim git command to visualize merge conflicts with windiff
- (maybe) move git lua files as exported git dotfiles
- ssh mode with local nvim buffers: technically, it is possible with sshfs, but running some locally installed commands on remote files takes forever. another way is use ssh port forwarding to run remote commands and fetch their output locally, but this either assumes local and remote paths to be the same or path mapping support, which is not the case for many commands, including some lsp servers.
- write handy snippets (e.g. python)
- Add Clipboard.ahk to windows-scripts
- Only pull repository info for the specific commit
- If needed in the future, use a .??-root.env file sourced by .profile and resourced by tmux, which sets env variables that depend on `??_ROOT`.
- Find a way to automatically name tmux windows with useful information. Try to ask suggestions to chatGPT for this.
- Update tmux, nvim, git versions and check for new functionalities
- Check out https://github.com/abhinav/tmux-fastcopy
- Consider using a mini-modal solution to pane resizing, both in tmux and nvim, to make it unnecessary for alt and ctrl to be pressed together (inspiration: https://github.com/whame/tmux-modal)
- Consider a solution to easily reorder panes in a window in tmux
- Consider a solution that saves content of tmux panes in a backup directory, so that you can have an idea of what you were working on after a reboot. Potentially, we could keep track of the state of the shells with hooks, so that we can reinflate the state automatically afterwards!
- Add tmux keybind to kill sessions without detaching (must be properly safeguarded)
- Move all dotfiles to separate git submodule
