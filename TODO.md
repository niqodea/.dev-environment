# TODO

- Add fzf plugin to nvim
- Provide an easy way to update PATH variable that is idempotent w.r.t. tmux (https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/366553)
- Install all programs inside the user's home directory
- Remove unused auto-loaded nvim plugins (e.g. matchit)
- In the installation script, generate dynamically some files (e.g. append source instructions to zshrc), then compare the final result with the current files to decide whether to backup them
