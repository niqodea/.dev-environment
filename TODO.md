# TODO

- Remove unused auto-loaded nvim plugins (e.g. matchit)
- Add nvim git command to visualize unchanged file side-by-side with windiff
- Add nvim git command to visualize merge conflicts with windiff
- (maybe) move nvim lua files dealing with git as exported git dotfiles
- write handy snippets (e.g. python)
- Only pull repository info for the specific commit
- Find a way to automatically name tmux windows with useful information. Try to ask suggestions to chatGPT for this.
- Update tmux, nvim, git versions and check for new functionalities
- Check out https://github.com/abhinav/tmux-fastcopy
- Consider using a mini-modal solution to pane resizing, both in tmux and nvim, to make it unnecessary for alt and ctrl to be pressed together (inspiration: https://github.com/whame/tmux-modal)
- Consider a solution to easily reorder panes in a window in tmux
- Consider a solution that saves content of tmux panes in a backup directory, so that you can have an idea of what you were working on after a reboot. Potentially, we could keep track of the state of the shells with hooks, so that we can reinflate the state automatically afterwards!
- Add tmux keybind to kill sessions without detaching (must be properly safeguarded)
- Move all dotfiles to separate git submodule
- Implement two different breadcrumbs command: `trail` (current) and `scatter` (recursively trail all directories, optionally with a max depth)
- Write READMEs for all modules
- Add configuration for optimized Xournal++ use (one hand for keyboard, other for pen)
- Compile ffmpeg and imagemagick
- Write aliases for ffmpeg and imagemagick
- Add automatic linting
