# TODO

- Add nvim git command to visualize unchanged file side-by-side with windiff
- Add nvim git command to visualize merge conflicts with windiff
- (maybe) move nvim lua files dealing with git as exported git dotfiles
- write handy snippets (e.g. python)
- Only pull repository info for the specific commit
- (maybe) heck out https://github.com/abhinav/tmux-fastcopy or alternatives
- (maybe) onsider using a mini-modal solution to pane resizing, both in tmux and nvim, to make it unnecessary for alt and ctrl to be pressed together (inspiration: https://github.com/whame/tmux-modal)
- Consider a solution that saves content of tmux panes in a backup directory, so that you can have an idea of what you were working on after a reboot. Potentially, we could keep track of the state of the shells with hooks, so that we can reinflate the state automatically afterwards!
- (maybe) move all dotfiles to separate git submodule
- Write READMEs for all modules
- (maybe) add configuration for optimized Xournal++ use (one hand for keyboard, other for pen) (if not possible with this tool, find another that best accommodates this workflow)
- Compile/install ffmpeg and imagemagick and write aliases for it
- Add automatic linting for sh files, lua files, ...
- Add docker (utils or module)
- Explore frecency solutions (zsh, nvim, tmux, ...)
- Look for/implement neovim command that restores all swap files as buffers (useful in case of crashes)
- Look for possible injection vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to using arbitrary paths to build command strings
- (maybe) refactor nvim dev modules to always be directories with an `init.lua` and other files that can be exported
- Create alias to deal with processes more easily (exposed ports with `lsof`, better `psg`, etc.)
- Find nvim window reordering solution (can be less complete than tmux's since closing a pane won't close the underlying buffer)
- Look into other tools for a richer, semantic diff
- Find a better way to manage zsh history (right now it starts from scratch each time we create a new session, not ideal)
- Implement git ls-files by modification date both as a command and in nvim
- Implement nvim string/lines diff solution (search the web, an idea could be to compare yank register and visual selection)
- Implement non-intrusive monitoring of key metrics like MEM usage, GPU usage, Disk usage (they should only be visually noticeable if above a critical threshold)
- Find a way to effortlessly move to edited parts of a Git-tracked file in neovim (not necessarily next/previous hunk from the git nvim plugin)
- Check for new functionalities of nvim, git versions
- Add git-active-files to https://github.com/ahmetsait/toolgit
- Find a better alternative to netrw (renaming files in netrw is extremely dangerous, it overwrites files without even mentioning it). We want an alternative that is lightweight and buffer-friendly.
- Personalize tmux status bar (e.g. use hburger to shorten long tmux session names)
- Restructure install script to be clearer
  - Support multiple platforms like Linux vs MacOS
  - Understand what's "foundational" (e.g. rsync) vs "nice-to-have" (e.g. breadcrumbs)
  - Understand how to cleanly separate what gets installed from source / tarball / apt
  - Do not install if program is already available in the path (perhaps opt-in)
- Find alternatives to copilot that do not rely on node
- Replace .breadcrumbs.bc with ..breadcrumbs
