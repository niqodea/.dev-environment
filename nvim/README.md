Module for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), my text editor of choice.

## Configuration

### Leader keybinds

We remap the `leader` key to <key>space</key> for simpler use.

We use `leader` as a prefix for custom keybinds.
We map prefixed keybinds to actions that are similar to their non-prefixed counterparts, ensuring intuitive usage.
Using `leader` for custom keybinds helps avoid messing with existing ones and makes it obvious which shortcuts are our own.
In environments with default Vim settings, we can simply ignore the original non-prefixed shortcuts.
This strategy is straightforward and requires minimal cognitive load.
