# export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

# Homebrew is a pain to share between many MacOS users, so we use a custom location for secondary users
# To do this, set HOMEBREW_PREFIX to "$HOME/.homebrew" in this script before running it:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/deb02e27d99fd2cb27ae16760e3a5272b612fded/install.sh
# export PATH="$HOME/.homebrew/bin:$PATH"
